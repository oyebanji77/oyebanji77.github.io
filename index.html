            <p>What is thought? </p>
            
            <p>Thought is often used broadly, for example, thought can be seen as "Everything that goes through our heads". Thought is restricted, as it excludes the five senses. A key part of thought are the beliefs that rest upon evidence and testimony. </p>
            
            <p>There are two degrees of beliefs: 1)Accepted with slight to no attempt to state the grounds that support such beliefs. 2)The basis of belief is deliberately sought. </p>
            
            <p>I. Reflective thoughts are random coursing of things through the mind. It involves a sequence of ideas and a consequence. One thought directly leads to another, as it aims at certain, specifc beliefs. </p>
            
            <p>II. It goes beyond observation. "I only thought of it" is a note of invention, such as imaginative stories. It is not reflective, as they do aim at knowledge. </p>
            
            <p>III. Belief has two parts. First, the grounds have not been considered, and second, the grounds have been examined. It could be superstition, adequate, or not. There is an attainment of belief. Prejudgements that can involve tradition, instruction, and imitation. </p>

            <p> My current research revolves around the discovery of young (&#8818; 1000 Myr) exoplanets using TESS data and characterizing the planet, host star, and host star's 
            association. I work with <a class='one' href="https://andrewwmann.com/index.html">Dr. Andrew Mann and the Young World's Lab</a> at UNC, where our main goal 
            is to understand how planets evolve over time. My thesis project will focus on constraining planet occurance rates and calculating statistical comparisons of properties 
            of planets at different ages. I released my first first-author paper in 2022 about the characterization of <a class='one' href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac7b28/meta">two planets in a 105 Myr stellar association</a>. 
            You can read more about my research <a class='one' href="papers.html">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p> I'm not currently teaching, but I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for <a class="one" href="https://21s.comp110.com/">COMP110</a> for three years. I worked with ~40 other undergrads to serve over 600 introductory
            computer science students each semester. I provided 5-6 one-on-one office hours and 2 hours of group tutoring per week, in addition to helping 
            answer questions during lecture, developing course material, and being the primary point-of-contact for ~20 students. </p>
